Iâ€™ve just started my PhD at UBC, and I feel like I need to practice my language A LOT. Not only writing, but reading, listening, and speaking as well. For <em>writing</em>, I decided to write blog posts regularly, without ChatGPTâ€™s help at all, which means my grammar and expressions will be awful.</p> <p>As a student coming from non-English speaking country, ChatGPT has been my great mentor for English writing. Since ChatGPT has become very popular, Iâ€™ve been receiving feedback from it regarding grammar and word choices. It was super convenient, because ChatGPT usually captures my intention quite well, even from a rough draft with a bunch of broken English. However, at some point, I started to feel like I want to stop relying on ChatGPT to finalize my writing. I did not enjoy the feeling of not being able to complete my task without an AI. Now that Iâ€™m pursuing my PhD, which is essentially a process of becoming an expert in my field, with a descent amount of writing being part of my job, I definitely want to become an independent, mature writer.</p> <p>So, the first and foremost goal of this blog will be to familiarize with writing a draft without LLM, and get closer to a good <em>academic</em> writer.</p> <p>Iâ€™ll start by simply writing down my experiences and thoughts, just like writing a diary, which will usually be about my grad life. Although my final goal is to become a better writer in academic writing, blog posts will be very casual. Because, again, the goal of this post is getting me familiar to writing by myself. I believe I first need to have an acceptable level of quality in casual writing to start with.</p> <p>To sum up,</p> <ul> <li>All text in all posts will not be revised by any LLM! It will be purely written by me, probably with a lot of broken English, weird combinations of words, wordy and ungrammatical sentences.</li> <li>I will instead let myself search for words with Google or Thesaurus.</li> <li>The posts will be in a very casual manner. I think it will not be TOO MUCH casual as in social media, but will just try to be comfortable. Comfortable but clean, and sometimes logical and reasonable writing is what I aim to practice.</li> <li>I will generally try to spend minimal time to rephrase or revise the writing, as this is for practice and I donâ€™t want to spend way too much time on this. At the same time, I also want to practice speeding up with my writing. I MIGHT occasionally spend time if I feel like it ðŸ™ƒ</li> </ul> <p>Please bear with me and be nice if anyone reading the posts finds any of them so awful. It already feels naked to post in this manner, but Iâ€™m willing to fail without shame in this space! Please please feel free to rephrase or point out grammar mistakes or anything, in a nice / clean / native-like way. Iâ€™m trying to improve!!</p> <p>Lastly, yes, I am not very confident with my English, and I AM nervous to have someone read my posts and hope that no one sees it on one hand, but I also have another little hope of connecting with other people, including grad students like myself, researchers from my field or outside, or maybe writing experts. Please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out if you feel like it!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="thoughts,"/><category term="diary"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[the first post]]></summary></entry></feed>

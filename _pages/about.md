Hi! I'm Haeji Jung, a master's graduate in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cs.korea.edu/en_cs/index.do) from Korea University in Seoul. Before that, I completed my bachelor's degree in [Korean Language with Literature](https://lib001.korea.edu/lib001_en/index.do), with a second major in Language, Brain, and Computer (LB&C) at the same university. I am currently a visiting researcher at the [ChangeLing Lab](https://changelinglab.github.io/) at [Language Technologies Institute](https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/), [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), where I work with [Prof. David R. Mortensen](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dmortens/). 

My current research interests focus on **multilingual representations**, particularly exploring the characteristics that contribute to strong cross-lingual and multilingual capabilities in language models. I am also looking forward to working on **cultural understandings and personalization of language models**, which I believe are key to benefiting more people and connecting them through language technologies.

Previously, I was part of the [Vision&AI Lab](https://visionai.korea.ac.kr/) in Korea University, where I worked on practical applications/scenarios such as Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning, Trajectory Prediction, and Remote Sensing, utilizing pre-trained representations---usually from another modality: text---to guide the learning of representations for target tasks. I also interned at [NAVER Cloud CLOVA](https://clova.ai/en), where I contributed to a research project on Visual Document Understanding, and could further explore multimodal approaches with a task that requires both vision and language understanding. I enjoyed investigating how different modalities align in latent space, how they can leverage each other in specific tasks, and eventually how such mechanism aligns with human congnition/intelligence.

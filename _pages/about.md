Hi! I'm Haeji Jung, currently a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/), advised by [Prof. Hila Gonen](https://gonenhila.github.io/).
<!-- Before that, I completed my bachelor's degree in [Korean Language and Literature](https://lib001.korea.edu/lib001_en/index.do), with a second major in Language, Brain, and Computer (LB&C) at the same university. I am currently a visiting researcher at the [ChangeLing Lab](https://changelinglab.github.io/) at [Language Technologies Institute](https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/), [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), where I work with [Prof. David R. Mortensen](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dmortens/).  -->
Previously, I spent time at [Language Technologies Institute, CMU](https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/) as a visiting researcher, working with [Prof. David Mortensen](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dmortens/). Before that, I've completed M.S. in Computer Science and Engineering, B.A. in Korean Language and Literature, and Bachelor's in Language, Brain & Computer at [Korea University](https://www.korea.edu/sites/en/index.do).

My current research interests focus on **multilingual representations**, particularly exploring the characteristics that contribute to strong cross-lingual and multilingual capabilities in language models. I am also looking forward to working on **multilingual factual hallucination** of language models, which I believe is crucial for reliable use of language models across various groups of people.
<!-- I am also looking forward to working on **cultural understandings and personalization of language models**, which I believe are key to benefiting more people and connecting them through language technologies. -->

<!-- I have also spent time at [Vision & AI Lab](https://visionai.korea.ac.kr/) in Korea University and at [NAVER Cloud CLOVA](https://clova.ai/en), where I contributed to research projects exploring **multimodal (vision and language) representations** to address various practical tasks including few-shot class-incremental learning, trajectory prediction, and remote sensing. Earlier on, I interned at [Kakao Enterprise](https://kakaoenterprise.com/) where I worked on generating Korean corpora to train an AI voice assistant as well as analyzing its errors, sparking my initial motivation to study machine learning and AI. -->
<!-- I took part in generating Korean corpora to train an AI voice assistant and analyzing failure cases from incoming user data, was initially motivated to study machine learning and AI during my first internship at [Kakao Enterprise](https://kakaoenterprise.com/), where I took part in generating Korean corpora to train an AI voice assistant and analyzing failure cases from incoming user data. -->

Please do not hesitate to reach out for any questions or potential collaborations!

<!-- Previously, I was part of the [Vision&AI Lab](https://visionai.korea.ac.kr/) in Korea University, where I worked on practical applications/scenarios such as Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning, Trajectory Prediction, and Remote Sensing, utilizing pre-trained representations---usually from another modality: text---to guide the learning of representations for target tasks. I also interned at [NAVER Cloud CLOVA](https://clova.ai/en), where I contributed to a research project on Visual Document Understanding, and could further explore multimodal approaches with a task that requires both vision and language understanding. I enjoyed investigating how different modalities align in latent space, how they can leverage each other in specific tasks, and eventually how such mechanism aligns with human congnition/intelligence.  -->
